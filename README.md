Rascql: Reactive, Asynchronous Scala Query Library
===

An asynchronous SQL client library for Scala using [reactive streams](http://reactive-streams.org/) built on top of [Akka](http://akka.io/).

Inspired by [postgresql-async](https://github.com/mauricio/postgresql-async).

The demo can be started using SBT:

    $ sbt
    sbt> test:run pguser pgpass

This project is a work-in-progress. Feedback and patches are welcome.
